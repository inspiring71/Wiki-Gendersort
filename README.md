# Wiki-Gendersort

This is the code and database behind the paper [Wiki-Gendersort: Automatic gender detection using first names in Wikipedia](https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/ezw7p/)

The gender association to the 586 132 names is available in the file NameKeyOut.txt as a tab separated flat file. The categories are M (male), F (female), UNI (unisex), UNK (unknown) and INI (initials).

I did not learn how to properly run a code in parallel back then, so please be kind on the (lack of) code quality. Comments are also currently mostly in French. I'll try to update the quality of the coding and documentation, but don't hold your breath.
